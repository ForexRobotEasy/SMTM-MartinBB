# SMTM MartinBB Trading Robot

This code is a trading robot developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. It is designed to execute trades based on the Martin strategy. The robot uses the MetaTrader 4 platform and requires the following libraries: Trade, PositionInfo, and SymbolInfo.

## Global Variables

- `CTrade trade`: Trade class object used for executing trades.
- `int magicNumber = 123456`: Magic number for trade identification.
- `double stopLoss = 50.0`: Stop loss value in points.
- `double lotSize`: Lot size for trade.

## Functions

### `double CalculateLotSize()`

This function calculates the lot size based on the market size. It uses the account balance, free margin, and market size information obtained from the SymbolInfo library. The maximum lot size is calculated as the free margin divided by the market size. The function then adjusts the lot size based on the market size range.

### `void OpenTrade(int type)`

This function opens a trade with the specified trade type (OP_BUY or OP_SELL). It gets the current price and calculates the stop loss price based on the stop loss value and the symbol's point value. It then sends a trade request using the Buy or Sell method of the trade object.

### `void CloseAllTrades()`

This function closes all open trades by iterating through each position and calling the PositionClose method of the trade object.

### `void ExecuteTrades()`

This function executes trades based on the defined parameters and strategies. It first checks the current market conditions by calculating the market size. Based on the market size range, it adjusts the stop loss value and calculates the lot size using the CalculateLotSize function.

Next, it executes trades based on the Martin strategy. It iterates five times and checks if there are already positions open for each iteration. If there are no positions open for a specific iteration, it opens a trade based on the trade type (OP_BUY or OP_SELL) determined by the iteration number.

### `void OnStart()`

This function is the entry point of the program. It first calls the CloseAllTrades function to close any existing trades. Then, it calls the ExecuteTrades function to execute new trades based on the defined parameters and strategies.
